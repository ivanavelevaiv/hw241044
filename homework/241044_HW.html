                If you ask a few people, you might get a few very different answers — but one thing they’ll probably all say is: “She might seem shy at first glance, but don’t let that fool you.”
                If you don’t know me, and you just read that sentence, you might think: “Wow, is she really that mean?”
                The truth is, I love to smile — I think it’s the most beautiful thing a person can have on their face. Once I feel comfortable around people, I let my true colors show. I enjoy making people smile, and I love the sound of a good laugh.
                Well... there’s always a catch, isn’t there?
                Just please don’t laugh when I’m serious — especially when I’m trying to study — because that’s when my inner demon might come out.

                Don’t worry — I have a really good (and even a bit surprising) explanation. According to the BuzzFeed quiz “Which cartoon character are you?”, the result I got was this little lady on your left.
                So how did I end up with this character? I answered a few slightly boring questions about what I would do in different situations. But what really surprised me was how accurate the analysis turned out to be.
                They wrote:
                "You're extremely astute and articulate. You have a real passion for listening to the underdog and doing everything in your power to change things for the better. You can sometimes find yourself correcting people a lot — for example, you care a lot about grammar and spelling — but ultimately, your heart is always in the right place."
                Honestly... not too far off. Lisa and I might have more in common than I thought.

                Oh, don’t worry — that’s just our little escape from reality: a tiny shopping addiction (tiny...ish). It turns out retail therapy is real, and sometimes your most loyal companions aren’t people — they’re the stores in your favorite mall.
                Thankfully, it's them and not my actual college friends draining my wallet. But hey, they say “you become like the people you surround yourself with”, right? So if we all mysteriously have the same problem — meet our mutual bestie: the one, the only, money-eating friend.
